This project implements a Blackjack card game emulator. It is currently single player I've considered adding multi-player. The first thing I need to fix is the random number generator. There is something wrong with the seed so I'll look for a better algorythm at some point.

I have a YouTube video of this project at http://youtu.be/2KkHXL5FuWQ
