This project implements a Blackjack card game emulator. It is currently single player but I'm considering adding multi-player. The first thing I need to fix is the random number generator. There is something wrong with the seed so I'll look for a better algorythm at some point.

I have a YouTube video of this project at http://youtu.be/2KkHXL5FuWQ

I just added the LiquidCrystal library to the Repo. On my system the path for the library is:
  C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\libraries\LiquidCrystal
This directory should contain the examples folder and the keywords.txt, LiquidCrystal.cpp and LiquidCrystal.h files.
